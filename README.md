# MongoDB Change Streams with Python

Change streams allow you to listen to changes that occur in your MongoDB database. On MongoDB 3.6 or above, this functionality allows you to build applications that can immediately respond to real time data changes.

In this [tutorial](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/python/python-change-streams), we'll show you how to use change streams with Python. In particular you will:
- Learn about change streams
- Create a program that listens to inserts
- Change the program to listen to other event types
